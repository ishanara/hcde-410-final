1) Motivation and problem statement
- I am planning to do this analysis because the United States of America is number one in the world for drug related deaths. Furthemore, drug related deaths are projected to increase. Lastly, drug addiction and drug related deaths have exploded in Seattle over the past 5 years. 
- I think its important to understand the potnetial correlation between intersections of identity and addiction and drug related deaths. Classism and systemic racism are deep rooted in America and I want to understand if these factors tangibly affect drug related deaths. 
- I want to understand the if there is a strong relationship between the following variables and Drug related deaths: Age, Race, City, Ethnicity, and Sex. I hope to learn how these factors affect drug related deaths. Afterwards I am going to do more research to understand why. 


2) Data selected for analysis
- This dataset analyzes accidental deaths associated with drug overdoses in Connecticut from 2012 to 2021. The data is derived from an investigation by the Office of the Cheif Medical Examiner which includes the toxicity report and death certificate. There are 48 columns in the dataset. 
- Link to Data Set: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/utkarshx27/accidental-drug-related-deaths-2012-2021
- License: U.S. Government Works https://www.usa.gov/government-works/
- This dataset is suitable for addressing my research goal because it contains all of the variables that I wanted to analyze and more (there are 48 columns). Furthermore, the dataset is very large and spans from 2012-2021. 
- One possible ethical issue with this data set is that the data set may not have had the permission of the deceased person or the decreased person's family to publish their data in this way. Secondly, alot of drug related deaths go unreported so conclusions that are reached through this data may not be entirely accurate. 


3) Unknowns and dependencies 
- I have done linear regression and hypthesis testing in a statics class before so I am confident that I will be able to complete the technical part of my project. 
- I am worried that the complexity of the project is too little. 

4) Overview and research questions 
- I wanted to explore the causes and ramifications of drug addiction in the United States broadly. On a personal note, a very close friend of mine fell into drug addiction for a period of time; ever since that period drug addiction as a topic is something that I wanted to better understand. The goal of this project is to identify correlations between various varibales and drug related deaths. After identifying these correlations within the dataset, I will further research the specific factors that have a high correlation with drug realted deaths. Here are some of the research questions that I am interested in answering: "Does Ethnicity affect drug related deaths"(will be computed my null hypthesis testing), "What is the correaltion between Residence State and Drug related deaths and Why might this be the case?" (completed with linear regression and external research). I also plan on computing analysis similar to the first question on variables such as age, sex, and race. From this analysis, I hope to understand which of these varibales might have an effect on drug related deaths (either due systematic reasons or other reasons -- I will explore this is suplemental reseach after the inital data analysis). 

5) Background and Related Work 
- There has been alot of previous research into drug addiction in the United States. This is evidenced through a quick google search of the topic. I was able to find that more than 106,000 people in the U.S. died from drug-involved overdoses in 2021; this is a 781% increase since 1999 (https://nida.nih.gov/research-topics/trends-statistics/overdose-death-rates#:~:text=More%20than%20106%2C000%20persons%20in,drugs%20from%201999%20to%202021.). Pertaining to drug related over doses from all drugs; Washington DC, West Virginia, and Kentucky have the highest rates in that order. Furthermore, more than 75% of drug overdoses involve opiods. 
- According to a study conducted by Pew Research Center published on January 19, 2022 (https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2022/01/19/recent-surge-in-u-s-drug-overdose-deaths-has-hit-black-men-the-hardest/), black men have been hit the hardest by the U.S. drug overdose death surge. Since 2015, the death rate among black men has tripping while the rates of death among other races have increased at a much slower pace. The study also takes about the death rates of other races(White, American Indian, Alaskan Native). Diving into this study lead me to really want to understand how and why race or ethnicty plays such an important role in the drug addiction or drug overdoses today. Particularly, how have these dynamics changes/not changed in recent years. The long timeline of my chosen data set (2012-2021) will allow me to compute and compare these metrics accross different time periods. Furthermore, this study talks about the sharp rise in drug realted deaths amongst women(specifically black women) in the United States. This also peaks my interest in the relation ship between sex and drug realted deaths and how that relationship has changed over time. 

6) Methodology 
- Link to a report that I completed in Statistics 311 to demonstrate that I will be able to complete the analysis that I am describing below: https://rpubs.com/isha_nara_/940217

- Analytical Methods: 
    -1) Understand the if there is a strong relationship between the following variables and Drug related deaths: Age, Race, City, Ethnicity, and Sex
        - To compute a baseline statistic for these variables I will be computing a null hypothesis test. If I am able to verify that there is a correlation between the variables then I will move onto analyzing them in more detail. 
    - 2) Understand how the correlation between variables has changed over time 
        - In order to get a better understanding of  the relationship between the variables I identified and drug related deaths; I want to compare and contrast correlation in different time periods. The two periods will be 2012-2016 and 2017-2021. 
        - I will compute a linear regression between these variables and drug related deaths. I will use the coefficients in front of each variable in order to compare and contrast correlation between the two different time periods. 
    - 3) From this point, I plan on doing supplemental research through per reviewed papers (such as pro publica) to gain a better understanding of the correlations I see/ or dont see in the data. 
- Method to present Findings: 
    - I plan on utilizing a simmilar model to how I presented my statistical report from Statistics 311. I want to utilize Null Distribution graphs to for the Null Hypothesis testing questions and to give the reader a better understanding of the linear regression model, I will display the 
- Why are the methods chosen useful: 
    - I beleive that I have selected the proper methods because I initially use null hypthesis testing to initally verify if there is a correlation. After this initial stage, I use linear regression to explore the relationship further.
