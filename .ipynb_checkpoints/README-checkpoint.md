Link to data set: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/utkarshx27/accidental-drug-related-deaths-2012-2021 

I wanted to anlyze accidental drug related deaths in the United States as North America is number one in the world for drug related deaths and the problem seems to be growing. The dataset includes variables such as age, race, ethnicity, city, and state. I want to analyze drug related deaths accross multiple variables and compute linear regressions to determine correlation.
