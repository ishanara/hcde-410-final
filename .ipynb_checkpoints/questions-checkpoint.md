1) Motivation and problem statement
- I am planning to do this analysis because the United States of America is number one in the world for drug related deaths. Furthemore, drug related deaths are projected to increase. Lastly, drug addiction and drug related deaths have exploded in Seattle over the past 5 years. 
- I think its important to understand the potnetial correlation between intersections of identity and addiction and drug related deaths. Classism and systemic racism are deep rooted in America and I want to understand if these factors tangibly affect drug related deaths. 
- I want to understand the if there is a strong relationship between the following variables and Drug related deaths: Age, Race, City, Ethnicity, and Sex. I hope to learn how these factors affect drug related deaths. Afterwards I am going to do more research to understand why. 


2) Data selected for analysis
- This dataset analyzes accidental deaths associated with drug overdoses in Connecticut from 2012 to 2021. The data is derived from an investigation by the Office of the Cheif Medical Examiner which includes the toxicity report and death certificate. There are 48 columns in the dataset. 
- Link to Data Set: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/utkarshx27/accidental-drug-related-deaths-2012-2021
- License: U.S. Government Works https://www.usa.gov/government-works/
- This dataset is suitable for addressing my research goal because it contains all of the variables that I wanted to analyze and more (there are 48 columns). Furthermore, the dataset is very large and spans from 2012-2021. 
- One possible ethical issue with this data set is that the data set may not have had the permission of the deceased person or the decreased person's family to publish their data in this way. Secondly, alot of drug related deaths go unreported so conclusions that are reached through this data may not be entirely accurate. 


3) Unknowns and dependencies 
- I have done linear regression and hypthesis testing in a statics class before so I am confident that I will be able to complete the technical part of my project. 
- I am worried that the complexity of the project is too little. 

4) Overview and research questions 
- I wanted to explore the causes and ramifications of drug addiction in the United States broadly. On a personal note, a very close friend of mine fell into drug addiction for a period of time; ever since that period drug addiction as a topic is something that I wanted to better understand. The goal of this project is to identify correlations between various varibales and drug related deaths. After identifying these correlations within the dataset, I will further research the specific factors that have a high correlation with drug realted deaths. Here are some of the research questions that I am interested in answering: "Does Ethnicity affect drug related deaths"(will be computed my null hypthesis testing), "What is the correaltion between Residence State and Drug related deaths and Why might this be the case?" (completed with linear regression and external research). I also plan on computing analysis similar to the first question on variables such as age, sex, and race. From this analysis, I hope to understand which of these varibales might have an effect on drug related deaths (either due systematic reasons or other reasons -- I will explore this is suplemental reseach after the inital data analysis). 

5) Background and Related Work 
- There has been alot of previous research into drug addiction in the United States.
