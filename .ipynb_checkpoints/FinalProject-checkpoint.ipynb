    "## Part 2: Introduction \n",
    "### High Level Overview: \n",
    "I am planning to do this analysis because the United States of America is number one in the world for drug related deaths. Furthemore, drug related deaths are projected to increase. Lastly, drug addiction and drug related deaths have exploded in Seattle over the past 5 years. I think its important to understand the potnetial correlation between intersections of identity and addiction and drug related deaths. Classism and systemic racism are deep rooted in America and I want to understand if these factors tangibly affect drug related deaths. I want to understand the if there is a strong relationship between the following variables and Drug related deaths: Age, Race, and Sex. Furthermore, I hope do in depth analysis of the ratios of specific drugs used in overdoses. I hope to learn how these factors affect drug related deaths. Afterwards I am going to do more research to understand why. \n",
    "### Data Selected for Analysis:\n",
    "- Link to Data Set: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/utkarshx27/accidental-drug-related-deaths-2012-2021\n",
    "- License: U.S. Government Works https://www.usa.gov/government-works/\n",
    "This dataset analyzes accidental deaths associated with drug overdoses in Connecticut from 2012 to 2021. The data is derived from an investigation by the Office of the Cheif Medical Examiner which includes the toxicity report and death certificate. There are 48 columns in the dataset and 9202 rows. This dataset is suitable for addressing my research goal because it contains all of the variables that I wanted to analyze and more (there are 48 columns). Furthermore, the dataset is very large and spans from 2012-2021. One possible ethical issue with this data set is that the data set may not have had the permission of the deceased person or the decreased person's family to publish their data in this way. Secondly, alot of drug related deaths go unreported so conclusions that are reached through this data may not be entirely accurate. "

    "## Part 3: Background or Related Work \n",
    "- There has been alot of previous research into drug addiction in the United States. This is evidenced through a quick google search of the topic. I was able to find that more than 106,000 people in the U.S. died from drug-involved overdoses in 2021; this is a 781% increase since 1999 (https://nida.nih.gov/research-topics/trends-statistics/overdose-death-rates#:~:text=More%20than%20106%2C000%20persons%20in,drugs%20from%201999%20to%202021.). Pertaining to drug related over doses from all drugs; Washington DC, West Virginia, and Kentucky have the highest rates in that order. Furthermore, more than 75% of drug overdoses involve opiods. \n",
    "- According to a study conducted by Pew Research Center published on January 19, 2022 (https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2022/01/19/recent-surge-in-u-s-drug-overdose-deaths-has-hit-black-men-the-hardest/), black men have been hit the hardest by the U.S. drug overdose death surge. Since 2015, the death rate among black men has tripping while the rates of death among other races have increased at a much slower pace. The study also takes about the death rates of other races(White, American Indian, Alaskan Native). Diving into this study lead me to really want to understand how and why race or ethnicty plays such an important role in the drug addiction or drug overdoses today. Particularly, how have these dynamics changes/not changed in recent years. The long timeline of my chosen data set (2012-2021) will allow me to compute and compare these metrics accross different time periods. Furthermore, this study talks about the sharp rise in drug realted deaths amongst women(specifically black women) in the United States. This also peaks my interest in the relation ship between sex and drug realted deaths and how that relationship has changed over time. "
